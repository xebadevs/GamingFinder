## About GamingFinder ðŸ”Ž

First portfolio project implementing React JS Library.

The main idea is based on consuming an API directly from React, providing a good treatment of the data on the front side together with a well-achieved interface and user experience.

The user can find significant data about free online PC games on the Web, access a description of all of them, some screenshots, their minimum system requirements and the website where to play or download it.
