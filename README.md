## About GamingFinder ðŸ”Ž
First portfolio project implementing React JS Library.

The main idea is based on consuming an API directly from React, providing a good treatment of the data on the front side together with a well-achieved interface and user experience.

The user can find significant data about free online PC games on the Web, access a description of all of them, some screenshots, their minimum system requirements and the website where to play or download it.

<br>


## Build With
- `React JS`
- `React Hooks`
- `Webpack`
- `API`
- `Bootstrap`

Extra Tools:
- `Photoshop`

## Technical Comments
I prioritized an orderly arrangement of the components: their location in the various folders, their names and their content.
Same thing about the routes on the url.

Also I tried to make the code clean and readable for any user.

Regarding the user experience, I looked for a way that the objective of the page was exposed from the first moment and without any room for confusion.
The `home page` was, in fact, the last page I created.
