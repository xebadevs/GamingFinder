## About GamingFinder ðŸ”Ž
First portfolio project implementing React JS Library.

The main idea is based on consuming an API directly from React, providing a good treatment of the data on the front side together with a well-achieved interface and user experience.

The user can find significant data about free online PC games on the Web, access a description of all of them, some screenshots, their minimum system requirements and the website where to play or download it.

## Build With
- `React JS`
- `React Hooks`
- `Webpack`
- `API`
- `Bootstrap`

Extra Tools:
- `Photoshop`

<br>


## Technical Comments
I prioritized an orderly arrangement of the components: their location in the various folders, their names and their content.

Also I tried to make the code readable for any user.
